<p>This working group is focused around implementation/design of the “foundations” for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other &quot;core&quot; bits of support offered by the Rust organization. We do not directly work on external projects like <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a>, <a href="https://async.rs/">async-std</a>, <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/">smol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akiles/embassy">embassy</a> and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="zulip"><a class="header" href="#zulip">Zulip</a></h2>
<p>We hold discussions on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187312-wg-async-foundations">the <code>#wg-async-foundations</code> stream in Zulip</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-this"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this">What is this</a></h2>
<p>We believe Rust can become one of the most popular choices for building distributed systems, ranging from embedded devices to foundational cloud services. Whatever they're using it for, we want all developers to love using Async Rust. For that to happen, we need to move Async Rust beyond the &quot;MVP&quot; state it's in today and make it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Async Rust. <strong>Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:</strong> how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a <em>joyful</em> one?</p>
<h2 id="where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going"><a class="header" href="#where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going">Where we are and where we are going</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;vision document&quot; starts with a <a href="./vision/characters.html">cast of characters</a>. Each character is tied to a particular Rust value (e.g., performance, productivity, etc) determined by their background; this background also informs the expectations they bring when using Rust. <a href="./vision/characters/grace.html">Grace</a>, for example, wants to keep the same level of performance she currently get with C, but with the productivity benefits of memory safety. <a href="./vision/characters/alan.html">Alan</a>, meanwhile, is hoping Rust will give him higher performance without losing the safety and ergonomics that he enjoys with garbage collected languages. </p>
<p>For each character, we write <a href="./vision/status_quo.html">&quot;status quo&quot; stories</a> that describe the challenges they face as they try to achieve their goals (and typically fail in dramatic fashion!), <strong>These stories are not fiction.</strong> They are an amalgamation of the real experiences of people using Async Rust, as reported to us by interviews, blog posts, and tweets. Writing these stories helps us gauge the cumulative impact of the various papercuts and challenges that one enconters when using Async Rust.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the vision doc, of course, is not just to tell us where we are now, but where we are going and how we will get there. For this, we include <a href="./vision/shiny_future.html">&quot;shiny future&quot; stories</a> that tell us how those same characters will fare in a few years time, when we've had a chance to improve the Async Rust experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-vision-drives-the-work"><a class="header" href="#the-vision-drives-the-work">The vision drives the work</a></h2>
<p>The vision is not just idle speculation. It is the central document that we use to organize ourselves. When we think about our <a href="./vision/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for any given year, it is always with the aim of moving us closer to the vision we lay out here.</p>
<h2 id="involving-the-whole-community"><a class="header" href="#involving-the-whole-community">Involving the whole community</a></h2>
<p>The async vision document provides a forum where the Async Rust community can plan a great overall experience for Async Rust users. Async Rust was intentionally designed not to have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mindset, and we don't want to change that. Our goal is to build a shared vision for the end-to-end experience while retaining the loosely coupled, exploration-oriented ecosystem we have built.</p>

<p>The process for writing the vision doc encourages active collaboration and &quot;position sum&quot; thinking. It begins with a <strong>brainstorming period</strong> in which we are inviting people to describe their experiences as &quot;status quo&quot; stories; later on, we'll start accepting &quot;shiny future&quot; stories. At the end of the brainstorming period, we will be giving <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> and then work on <strong>harmonizing</strong> the stories into a coherent whole.</p>

<li>Folks <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">open status quo</a> and (eventually) <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/shiny_future.html">shiny future</a> narrative PRs.</li>
<li>We collectively <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/comment.html">comment</a> on these PRs, helping to improve them and make them more complete.</li>
<li>At the end of the brainstorming period, we will vote and give <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> for things like &quot;most amusing&quot;. (We'd like suggestions on the best categories!)</li>
<li>All PRs opened in this section will be merged into a &quot;brainstorming&quot; folder; they become the basis for the final document.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During this brainstorming period, we want to focus on getting as many ideas as we can.</strong> Having multiple &quot;shiny futures&quot; that address the same problem is a feature, not a bug, as it will let us mix-and-match later to try and find the best overall plan. Comments and questions will be used as a [tool for improving understanding or sharpening proposals.][c] Presenting alternative ideas is done by [writing an alternative narrative][alt].</p>
<h3 id="harmonizing"><a class="header" href="#harmonizing">Harmonizing</a></h3>
<p>At this point, the <a href="vision/../welcome.html#leads">wg leads</a> will write the draft vision document, drawing on the status quo and shiny future stories that were submitted.
Like an RFC, this draft vision doc will be opened for comment and improved based on the resulting feedback.
When the <a href="vision/../welcome.html#leads">wg leads</a> feel it is ready, it will be taken to the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang">lang</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library">libs</a> teams for approval (and other Rust teams as appropriate).</p>
<h3 id="living-document"><a class="header" href="#living-document">Living document</a></h3>
<p>This meant to be a <strong>living document</strong>. We plan to revisit it regularly to track our progress and update it based on what we've learned in the meantime. Note that the shiny future stories in particular are going to involve a fair bit of uncertainty, so we expect them to change as we go.</p>
<h2 id="wait-did-somebody-say-awards"><a class="header" href="#wait-did-somebody-say-awards">Wait, did somebody say awards?</a></h2>
<p>Yes! We are planning to give <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> in various categories for folks who write <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/status_quo.html">status quo</a> and <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/shiny_future.html">shiny future</a> PRs. The precise categories are TBD. Check out the <a href="vision/./how_to_vision/awards.html">awards</a> page for more details.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this-1">What is this?</a></h2>
<p>We aim for the <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../applications.html">list of applications</a> to be comprehensive. Feel free to open PRs that either add new applications or adjust the wording on 
existing ones. The <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../welcome.html#leads">wg leads</a> may choose however not to add an application, or to generalize an existing category instead.</p>
<h2 id="faqs-to-answer-in-your-pr"><a class="header" href="#faqs-to-answer-in-your-pr">FAQs to answer in your PR</a></h2>
<p>In your PR, make sure to include the following FAQs (and potentially others):</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes this application different from most others?</li>
<li>What are some examples of crates in this category?
<ul>
<li>We have to be careful with this, we don't want it to seem like we're picking favorites, but we also don't want the pressure to be comprehensive. Maybe we can link to crates.io tags or something?</li>

<h1 id="-how-to-vision-status-quo-stories"><a class="header" href="#-how-to-vision-status-quo-stories">❓ How to vision: &quot;Status quo&quot; stories</a></h1>
<p>We want to make sure all Async Rust users and their experiences are reflected in the async vision doc, so please help us by writing 'status quo' stories about your experiences or the experiences of others! Remember, <strong>status quo stories are not &quot;real&quot;, but neither are they fiction.</strong> They are constructed from the real experiences of people using Async Rust (often multiple people). </p>
<h2 id="goals-of-a-status-quo-pr"><a class="header" href="#goals-of-a-status-quo-pr">Goals of a status quo PR</a></h2>
<p>When writing a <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../status_quo.html">status quo</a> narrative, your goal is to present what you see as a major challenge for Async Rust. You want to draw upon people's experiences (sometimes multiple people) to show all the aspects of the problem in an engaging and entertaining way.</p>
<p>Each story is always presented from the POV of a particular <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../characters.html">character</a>. Stories should be detailed, not abstract -- it's better to give specifics than generalities. Don't say &quot;Grace visited a website to find the answer to her question&quot;, tell us whether she went to stackoverflow, asked on reddit, or found the answer on some random blog post. Ideally you should get this detail from whatever your &quot;source&quot; of the story is -- but if you are using multiple sources and they disagree, you can pick one and use the FAQ to convey some of the other alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-faq"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-the-faq">The role of the FAQ</a></h2>
<p>Every status quo PR includes a FAQ. This FAQ should always include answers to some standard questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the morals of the story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about the major takeaways-- what do you see as the biggest problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the sources for this story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about what the story is based on, ideally with links to blog posts, tweets, or other evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why did you choose <em>NAME</em> to tell this story?
<ul>
<li>Talk about the character you used for the story and why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would this story have played out differently for the other characters?
<ul>
<li>In some cases, there are problems that only occur for people from specific backgrounds, or which play out differently. This question can be used to highlight that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can feel free to add whatever other FAQs seem appropriate. You should also expect to grow the FAQ in response to questions that come up on the PR.</p>
<h2 id="the-review-process"><a class="header" href="#the-review-process">The review process</a></h2>
<p>When you opan a status quo PR, people will start to <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./comment.html">comment</a> on it. These comments should always be constructive, with the goal not of negating the story but of making it more precise or more persuasive. Ideally, you should respond to every comment in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust the story with more details or to correct factual errors.</li>
<li>Add something to the story's FAQ to explain the confusion.
<ul>
<li>If the question is already covered by a FAQ, you can just refer the commenter to that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is that, at the end of the review process, the status quo story has a lot more details that address the major questions people had.</p>
<h2 id="-frequently-asked-questions"><a class="header" href="#-frequently-asked-questions">🤔 Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the process to propose a status quo story?
<ul>
<li>Just open a PR!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if my story applies to multiple characters?
<ul>
<li>Look at the &quot;morals&quot; of your story and decide which character will let you get those across the best.</li>
<li>Use the FAQ to talk about how other characters might have been impacted.</li>
<li>If the story would play out really differently for other characters, maybe write it more than once!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much detail should I give? How specific should I be?
<ul>
<li>Detailed is generally better, but only if those details are helpful for understanding the morals of your story.</li>
<li>Specific is generally better, since an abstract story doesn't feel as real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should I do when I'm trying to be specific but I have to make an arbitrary choice?
<ul>
<li>Add a FAQ with some of the other alterantives, or just acknowledging that you made an arbitrary choice there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>None of the characters are a fit for my story.
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have to be perfect. Pick the one that seems like the closest fit. If you really feel stuck, though, come talk to us on [Zulip] about it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How should I describe the &quot;evidence&quot; for my status quo story?
<ul>
<li>The more specific you can get, the better. If you can link to tweets or blog posts, that's ideal. You can also add notes into the [conversations] folder and link to those. Of course, you should be sure people are ok with that.</li>

<p>Like <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./status_quo.html">status quo stories</a>, each shiny future story is always presented from the POV of a particular <a href="vision/how_to_vision/../characters.html">character</a>.

<h2 id="be-respectful-and-supportive"><a class="header" href="#be-respectful-and-supportive">Be respectful and supportive</a></h2>
<p>Writing a &quot;status quo&quot; or &quot;shiny future&quot; story is an act of bravery and vulnerability. In the status quo, we are asking people to talk about the things that they or others found hard, to admit that they had trouble figuring something out. In the case of the shiny future, we're asking people to put out half-baked ideas so that we can find the seeds that will grow into something amazing. It doesn't take much to make that go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="comment-to-understand-or-improve-not-to-negate-or-dissuade"><a class="header" href="#comment-to-understand-or-improve-not-to-negate-or-dissuade">Comment to understand or improve, not to negate or dissuade</a></h2>

<p>“Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.”</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5/">Stephen Covey</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The golden rule is that when you leave a comment, you are looking to understand or improve the story. </p>
<p>For status quo stories, remember that these are true stories about people's experiences -- they can't be <em>wrong</em> (though they could be inaccurate). It may be that somebody tries for days to solve a problem that would've been easy if they had just known to call a particular method. That story is not wrong, it's an opportunity to write a shiny future story in which you explain how they would've learned about that method, or perhaps about how that method would become unnecessary.</p>
<p>For shiny future stories, even if you don't like the idea, you should ask comments with the goal of better understanding what the author likes about it. Understanding that may give you an idea for how to get those same benefits in a way that you are happier with. It's also valid to encourage the author to elaborate on the impact their story will have on different characters.</p>

<p>Remember, opening your own PR is free (In fact, we're giving an <a href="vision/how_to_vision/./awards.html">award</a> for being &quot;most prolific&quot;). If you find that you had a really different experience than a status quo story, or you have a different idea for a shiny future, consider just writing your own PR instead of commenting negatively on someone else's. The goal of the brainstorming phase is to put a lot of alternatives, so that we can look for opportunities to combine them and make something with the best of both. </p>

<h1 id="-design-tenets-for-async"><a class="header" href="#-design-tenets-for-async">✏️ Design tenets for async</a></h1>
<table><thead><tr><th>Status</th><th>Owner</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>⚠️ Draft ⚠️</td><td>nikomatsakis</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Draft status.</strong> These tenets are a first draft. nikomatsakis plans to incorporate feedback and revise them before they are finalized.</p>
<p>The design tenets describe the key principles that drive our work on async. Hopefully, we are able to achieve and honor all of them all of the time. Sometimes, though, they come into conflict, and we have to pick -- in that case, we prefer the tenet earlier in the list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minimal overhead.</strong> Rust Async I/O performance should compare favourably with any other language. In the extreme case, it should be possible to use async/await without any required allocation, although this is unlikely to be a common case in production systems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to get started, but able to do anything you want.</strong> We should make it simple to write Async I/O code and get things that work reasonably well, but it should be possible for people to obtain fine-grained control as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Async is like sync, but with blocking points clearly identified.</strong> At the highest level, writing a simple program using asynchronous I/O in Rust should be analogous to writing one that uses synchronous I/O, except that one adds <code>async</code> in front of function declarations and adds <code>.await</code> after each call. We should aim for analogous design between synchronous and asynchronous equivalents. Similarly, streams should be like asynchronous iterators. One should be able to use the same sort of combinators with streams and to iterate over them in analogous ways.</li>
<li><strong>No one true runtime.</strong> We need to be able to hook into existing runtimes in different environments, from embedded environments to runtimes like node.js. Specialized systems need specialized runtimes. </li>
<li><strong>Library ecosystem is key.</strong> We want to have a strong ecosystem of async crates, utilities, and frameworks. This will require mechanisms to write libraries/utilities/frameworks that are generic and interoperable across runtimes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stress-tests"><a class="header" href="#stress-tests">Stress tests</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Stress tests&quot; are important use cases that tend to &quot;stretch&quot; the design. When we are contemplating changes, it's important to look over the stress tests and make sure that they all still work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-threaded executors:</strong> Some systems tie each task to a single thread; such tasks should be able to access data that is not <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, and the executor for those tasks should be able to be fully optimized to avoid atomic accesses, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded executors:</strong> Many systems migrate tasks between threads transparently, and that should be supported as well, though tasks will be required to be <code>Send</code>.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Bring your own runtime&quot;:</strong> The Rust language itself should not require that you start threads, use epoll, or do any other particular thing.</li>
<li><strong>Zero allocation, single task:</strong> Embedded systems might want to be able to have a single task that is polled to completion and which does no allocation whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple runtimes in one process:</strong> Sometimes people have to combine systems, each of which come with their own event loop. We should avoid assuming there is one global event loop in the system. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Rust based runtimes:</strong> Sometimes people want to integrate into event loops from other, non-Rust-based systems.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly in the browser:</strong> We want to integrate with WebAssembly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-this-2"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this-2">What is this?</a></h2>

These characters are the protagonists of our <a href="vision/./status_quo.html">status quo</a> and <a href="vision/./shiny_future.html">shiny future</a> stories, and they help us to think about the different kinds of priorities and expectations that people bring to Async Rust. Having names and personalities also makes the stories more fun and approachable.</p>
<p>In some cases, the characters have multiple variants. For example, the &quot;systems programming expert&quot; Grace has both a <a href="vision/./characters/grace.html#variant-a-networking-systems">networking systems variant</a> and an <a href="vision/./characters/grace.html#variant-b-embedded">embedded variant</a>.

<h3 id="variant-a-dynamic-languages"><a class="header" href="#variant-a-dynamic-languages">Variant A: Dynamic languages</a></h3>
<p>Alan has been programming for years. He has built systems in Ruby on Rails, node.js, and used Django too. Lately he's been learning Rust and he is tinkering with integrating Rust into some of his projects to get better performance and reliability. He's also building some projects entirely in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="variant-b-java"><a class="header" href="#variant-b-java">Variant B: Java</a></h3>
<p>Alan works at a Java shop. They run a number of network services built in Java, along with some that use Kotlin or Scala. He's very familiar with the Java ecosystem and the tooling that the JVM offers. He's also sometimes had to tweak his code to work around garbage collector latencies or to reduce overall memory usage. He's curious to try porting some systems to Rust to see how it works.</p>
<h3 id="variant-c-kotlin"><a class="header" href="#variant-c-kotlin">Variant C: Kotlin</a></h3>
<p>Alan is developing networking programs in Kotlin. He loves Kotlin for its expressive syntax and clean integration with Java. Still, he sometimes encounters problems running his services due to garbage collection latencies or overall memory usage. He's heard that Rust can be fun to use too, and is curious to try it out.</p>

<h3 id="variant-a-networking-systems"><a class="header" href="#variant-a-networking-systems">Variant A: Networking systems</a></h3>
<p>Grace has been building high-performance networking systems in C and C++ for a number of years. She's accustomed to hacking lots of low-level details to coax the most performance she can from her network stack. She's also experienced her share of epic debugging sessions resulting from memory errors in C. She's intrigued by Rust: she likes the idea of getting the same control and performance she gets from C but with the productivity benefits she gets from memory safety. She's currently experimenting with introducing Rust into some of the systems she works on, and she's considering Rust for a few greenfield projects as well.</p>
<h3 id="variant-b-embedded"><a class="header" href="#variant-b-embedded">Variant B: Embedded</a></h3>
<p>Grace is building a sensor mesh on microcontrollers using Rust. The nodes communicate wirelessly to relay their results, and Grace is responsible for the networking component. These sensors are built using very constrained and low power hardware without operating system, so she is coding in a <code>#[no_std]</code> environment and is very careful about available resources.</p>

<h2 id="-frequently-asked-questions-8"><a class="header" href="#-frequently-asked-questions-8">🤔 Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>What are some of the &quot;special requirements&quot; for embedded applications?
<ul>
<li>Embedded developers need to write error-free applications outside of the comfort zone of an operating system. Rust helps to prevent many classes of programming errors at compile time which inspires confidence in the software quality and and cuts time intensive build-flash-test iterations.</li>
<li>Embedded developers needs good hardware abstraction. Frameworks in other languages do not provide the sophistacted memory mapped IO to safe type abstraction tooling which have been created by the Rust teams.</li>
<li>Embedded developers care about hard real time capabilities; the concept of &quot;you only pay for what you use&quot; is very important in embedded applications. The combination of the inherently asynchronous interrupt handling of microcontrollers with the Rust async building blocks are a perfect match to effortlessly create applications with hard realtime capabilities.</li>
<li>Embedded developers are particularly appreciative of strong tooling support. The availibity of the full environment via <code>rustup</code> and the integration of the full toolchain with <code>cargo</code> and <code>build.rs</code> make her very happy because she can focus on what she does best instead of having regular fights with the environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do embedded applications require custom tailored runtimes?
<ul>
<li>Likely yes! The tradeoffs for an embedded application and a typical server are very different. Further, most server-grade frameworks are not <code>#[no_std]</code> compatible and far exceeded the available footprint on an embedded device.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;status quo&quot; stories document the experience of using Async Rust today. Each story narrates the challenges encountered by <a href="vision/./characters.html">one of our characters</a> as they try (and typically fail in dramatic fashion) to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Writing the &quot;status quo&quot; stories helps us to compensate for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge</a>: the folks working on Async Rust tend to be experts in Async Rust. We've gotten used to the workarounds required to be productive, and we know the little tips and tricks that can get you out of a jam.

<p>When examining her service metrics, <a href="vision/status_quo/../characters/grace.html">Grace</a> notices tail latencies in the P99 that exceed their target. She identifies GC in the routing layer as the culprit. Grace follows industry trends and is already aware of Rust and its ecosystem at a high level. She decides to investigate rewriting the routing service in Rust.</p>
<p>To meet throughput requirements, Grace has already decided to use a thread-per-core model and minimize cross-thread communication. She explores available ecosystem options and finds no option that gets her exactly what she is looking for out of the box. However, she can use Tokio with minimal configuration to achieve her architecture.</p>
<p>A few months of frantic hacking follow.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ule4vhcY1xEKQ/giphy.gif" alt="montage of cats typing" width=200></img></p>
<p>Soon enough, she and her team have a proof of concept working. They run some local stress tests and notice that 5% of requests hang and fail to respond. The client eventually times out. She cannot reproduce this problem when running one-off requests locally. It only shows up when sending above 200 requests-per-second. </p>
<p>She realizes that she doesn't have any tooling to give her insight into what's going on. She starts to add lots of logging, attempting to tie log entries to specific connections. Using an operating system tool, she can identify the socket addresses for the hung connections, so she also includes the socket addresses in each log message. She then filters the logs to find entries associated with hung connections. Of course, the logs only tell her what the connection managed to do successfully; they don't tell her why it stopped -- so she keeps going back to add more logging until she can narrow down the exact call that hangs.</p>
<p>Eventually, she identifies that the last log message is right before authenticating the request. An existing C library performs authentication, integrated with the routing service using a custom future implementation. She eventually finds a bug in the implementation that resulted in occasional lost wake-ups.</p>
<p>She fixes the bug. The service is now working as expected and meeting Grace's performance goals.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are the morals of the story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>When coming from a background of network engineering, users will bring their own design choices around architecture.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <a href="http://seastar.io/">seastar</a> and <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glommio/">Glommio</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a lack of debugging tools for async.</li>
<li>Writing futures by hand is error prone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the sources for this story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is based on the experiences of helping a tokio user to diagnose a bug in their code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why did you choose Grace to tell this story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The actual user who experienced this problem fit the profile of Grace.</li>
<li>The story is focused on the experience of people aiming to use workflows they are familiar with from C in a Rust setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How would this story have played out differently for the other characters?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alan or Niklaus may well have had a much harder time diagnosing the problem due to not having as much of a background in systems programming. For example, they may not have known about the system tool that allowed them to find the list of dangling connections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Could Grace have used another runtime to achieve the same objectives?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maybe! But in this instance the people this story is based on were using tokio, so that's the one we wrote into the story.</li>
<li>(If folks want to expand this answer with details of how to achieve similar goals on other runtimes that would be welcome!)</li>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a> tracks various bugs and other work items for the async foundation group.
It is used to drive the triage process.</p>
<h2 id="triage-process"><a class="header" href="#triage-process">Triage process</a></h2>
<p>In our weekly triage meetings, we take new issues assigned <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-async-await"><code>A-async-await</code></a> and categorize them. 
The process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a>, from right to left:
<ul>
<li>Look at what got <strong>Done</strong>, and celebrate! :tada:</li>
<li>Review <strong>In progress</strong> issues to check we are making progress and there is a clear path to finishing (otherwise, move to the appropriate column)</li>
<li>Review <strong>Blocked</strong> issues to see if there is anything we can do to unblock</li>
<li>Review <strong>Claimed</strong> issues to see if they are in progress, and if the assigned person still intends to work on it</li>
<li>Review <strong>To do</strong> issues and assign to anyone who wants to work on something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-async-await+is%3Aopen+-label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged&amp;type=Issues">uncategorized issues</a>
<ul>
<li>Mark <code>P-low</code>, <code>P-medium</code>, or <code>P-high</code></li>
<li>Add <code>P-high</code> and <em>assigned</em> <code>E-needs-mentor</code> issues to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a></li>
<li>Mark <code>AsyncAwait-triaged</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's still a shortage of <strong>To do</strong> issues, review the list of <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-medium+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-medium</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-low+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-low</code></a> issues for candidates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mentoring"><a class="header" href="#mentoring">Mentoring</a></h2>
<p>If an issue is a good candidate for mentoring, mark <code>E-needs-mentor</code> and try to find a mentor.</p>
<p>Mentors assigned to issues should write up mentoring instructions. 
<strong>Often, this is just a couple lines pointing to the relevant code.</strong> 
Mentorship doesn't require intimate knowledge of the compiler, just some familiarity and a willingness to look around for the right code.</p>
<p>After writing instructions, mentors should un-assign themselves, add <code>E-mentor</code>, and remove <code>E-needs-mentor</code>. 
On the project board, if a mentor is assigned to an issue, it should go to the <strong>Claimed</strong> column until mentoring instructions are provided. 
After that, it should go to <strong>To do</strong> until someone has volunteered to work on it.</p>
<h1 id="-design-documents"><a class="header" href="#-design-documents">🔬 Design documents</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>design documents</strong> (or &quot;design docs&quot;, more commonly) describe potential designs. These docs vary greatly in terms of their readiness to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early on, they describe a vague idea for a future. Often this takes the shape of capturing constraints on the solution, rather than the solution itself.</li>
<li>When a feature is getting ready to ship, they can evolve into a full blown RFC, with links to tracking issues or other notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="early-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#early-stage-design-docs">Early stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>In the early stages, design docs are meant to capture interesting bits of &quot;async design space&quot;. They are often updated to capture the results of a fruitful conversation or thread which uncovered contraints or challenges in solving a particular problem. They will capture a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use cases;</li>
<li>interesting aspects to the design;</li>
<li>alternatives;</li>
<li>interactions with other features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="late-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#late-stage-design-docs">Late stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>As a design progresses, the doc should get more and more complete, until it becomes something akin to an RFC. (Often, at that point, we will expand the design document into a directory, adding an actual RFC draft and other contents; those things can live in this repo or elsewhere, depending.) Once we decide to put a design doc onto the roadmap, it will also contain links to tracking issues or other places to track the status.</p>

<h2 id="use-case"><a class="header" href="#use-case">Use-case</a></h2>
<p>Some types should not be held across a &quot;yield&quot; bound. A typical example is a <code>MutexGuard</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn example(x: &amp;Lock&lt;u32&gt;) {
    let data = x.lock().unwrap();
    something().await;
    *data += 1;
}

async fn something() { }
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, a lot of these issues are avoided because <code>MutexGuard</code> is not <code>Send</code>, but single-thread runtimes hit these issues.</p>

<li>e.g., <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.poll_next_unpin"><code>poll_next_unpin</code></a> can make working with pin easier, albeit at a loss of generality

<ul>
<li>&quot;Async has worked well so far.  My top wishlist items are Sink and Stream traits in std.  It's quite difficult to abstract over types that asynchronously produce or consume values.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;AsyncRead/AsyncWrite work fine for files, tcp streams, etc.  But once you are past I/O and want to pass around structs, Sink and Stream are needed.  One example of fragmentation is that Tokio channels used to implement the futures Sink/Stream traits, but no longer do in 1.0.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I usually use Sink/Stream to abstract over different async channel types.  Sometimes to hide the details of external dependencies from a task (e.g. where is this data going?).  And sometimes to write common utility methods.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One thing I can think of: there are still a lot of popular libraries that don't have async support (or are just getting there).  Rocket, Criterion, Crossterm's execute, etc.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<li>&quot;I've written a bit of rust before, but rust is my first introduction to Async. My main gripes are that it's hard to figure our what the &quot;blessed&quot; way of doing async is. I'd love to see async included in the book, but I understand that async is still evolving too much for that.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Adding to the confusion: theres multiple executors, and they have a bit of lock in. Async libraries being dependent on which executor version I use is also confusing for newcomers. In other langs, it seems like one just uses everything from the stdlib and everything is compatible&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That kind of gave me a lot of hesitation/fomo in the beginning, because it felt like I had to make some big choices around my tech stack that I felt I would be stuck with later. I ended up chatting about this in the discord &amp; researching for multiple days before getting started.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Also, due to there not being a &quot;blessed&quot; approach, I don't know if I'm working with some misconceptions around async in rust, and will end up discovering I will need to redo large parts of what I wrote.&quot;</li>
